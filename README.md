# OAuth Authentication with Firebase

> React app to showcase OAuth Authentication with GitHub, Twitter and Facebook using Firebase

This app has been bootstrapped with Create React App so you will need `create-react-app` installed.

To install

```
$ npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Usage

**Install dependencies**

```
$ yarn
$ cd client
$ yarn
$ cd ..
```

**Run development server**

- From root directory

```
$ yarn dev:client
```

- From client directory

```
$ yarn start
```

**Production**

```
$ dev:server
```

This will create the production build and Node will serve the app, then you can visit http://localhost:5000/

## Setup

First create the required `.env` file, run

```
$ cd client && yarn setup
```

Before we begin working on the React app, we will need to create a project in Firebase, then setup new apps on GitHub, Twitter and Facebook.
